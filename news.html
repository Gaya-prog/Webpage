                    Nanofertech received the prestigious L-Grant Entrepreneur Life-tech Award from Leave A Nest, Malaysia and Japan, in recognition of its pioneering technology in precision fertilization. The award ceremony was held at the Tan Sri Lee Lam Thye Hall, National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Bandar Baru Bangi, Selangor. This groundbreaking controlled-release technology uses neural networks to precisely navigate nutrient release, optimizing crop growth and reducing environmental impact. Nanofertech’s approach is a game-changer in the agricultural industry, addressing both the need for higher crop yields and the global demand for more sustainable farming practices.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The integration of neural networks allows for the timely and efficient release of nutrients, ensuring that plants receive exactly what they need when they need it, minimizing fertilizer waste and nutrient runoff. During the ceremony, Nanofertech was presented with a cash prize of 100,000 yen and an award certificate, underscoring the significance of their contribution to the agri-tech sector. The award recognizes the startup’s commitment towards sustainable agricultural practices, making it a key player in the future of precision farming. This recognition marks a significant milestone for Nanofertech as it continues to scale its solutions and collaborate with agricultural stakeholders to implement its technology on a wider scale.
